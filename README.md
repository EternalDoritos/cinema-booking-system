The task given to our group is the development of a comprehensive cinema ticket booking system (System).

Support and manage different types of users, including system administrators, managers, staff, and customers. Each user has a distinct profile, user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the system and protect sensitive user information.

Cinema managers should be able to allocate movie sessions to specific cinema rooms, taking into account movie popularity, anticipated audience size, and available resources. Handle conflicts or overlapping schedules to avoid double bookings and ensure a streamlined cinema management process.

Ticket booking and purchase functionality. Customers should be able to browse through available movie sessions, select their desired movie, date, and time.
